Build a number Guessing Game in which the user selects a range. Assume the user selected a range from X to Y where both X and Y are integers. So a random number in that range is selected by the system where the user needs to guess the number in minimum number of guesses.
The game offers feedback on each guess, indicating if it is too low, too high, or correct, and continues until the correct number is guessed, at which point it displays a congratulatory message with the total number of guesses. Handle edge cases such as non-integer values for bounds, a lower bound greater than or equal to the upper bound, guesses outside the range, and non-integer guesses.

The game offers feedback on each guess, indicating if it is too low, too high, or correct, and continues until the correct number is guessed, at which point it displays a congratulatory message with the total number of guesses. Handle edge cases such as non-integer values for bounds, a lower bound greater than or equal to the upper bound, guesses outside the range, and non-integer guesses.
